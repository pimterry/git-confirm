# git-confirm [![Travis Build Status](https://img.shields.io/travis/pimterry/git-confirm.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/pimterry/git-confirm)
Git hook to catch placeholders and temporary changes (TODO / @ignore) before you commit them.

Git Confirm:

* Stops you ever accidentally committing bad temporary changes.
* Is interactive, checking each match with you so you can't miss it (and can still include it if you like).
* Only considers lines newly `add`ed and about to be committed, so no false positives.
* Includes (diff-colorized) context with each match
* Installs in any project with a single command
* Is configurable to match any number of strings, through standard git config
* Is well tested. See [tests/test-hook.bats](https://github.com/pimterry/git-confirm/blob/master/test/test-hook.bats#L40-L9999).
* Works on Linux, OSX and Windows ([in Powershell at least](https://twitter.com/afnpires/status/768403583263973376)), with no dependencies.

## To Install
In the root of your Git repository, run:

```bash
curl https://cdn.rawgit.com/pimterry/git-confirm/v0.2.1/hook.sh > .git/hooks/pre-commit && chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit
```
(*Note the version number*)

or to install it globally on v2.9+, you can run:

```bash
mkdir ~/.git-hooks
git config --global core.hooksPath ~/.git-hooks
curl https://cdn.rawgit.com/pimterry/git-confirm/v0.2.1/hook.sh > ~/.git-hooks/pre-commit
chmod +x ~/.git-hooks/pre-commit
```

All done. If you want to check it's installed correctly you can run:

```bash
echo "TODO" > ./test-git-confirm
git add ./test-git-confirm

# Should prompt you to confirm added 'TODO'. Press 'n' to cancel commit.
git commit -m "Testing git confirm"
```

*If you're security conscious, you may be reasonably suspicious of
[curling executable files](https://www.seancassidy.me/dont-pipe-to-your-shell.html).
Here you're on HTTPS throughout though, and you're not piping directly to execution so you can
check contents and the hash (against MD5 04baf1f87974681a92ee7fe8c0aa3aaa for v0.2.1) before using this, if you like.*

## To Configure

By default, git-confirm will catch and warn about lines including 'TODO' only.

If you want to match a different pattern, you can override this default and set your own patterns:

```bash
git config --add hooks.confirm.match "TODO"
```

Matches are passed verbatim to your local `grep`, and are treated as regular expressions. Note that all matches are case-sensitive.

You can repeatedly add patterns, and each of them will be matched in turn. To get, remove or totally
clear your config, use the standard [Git Config](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-config) commands:

```bash
git config --get-all hooks.confirm.match
git config --unset hooks.confirm.match 'TODO'
git config --unset-all hooks.confirm.match
```
